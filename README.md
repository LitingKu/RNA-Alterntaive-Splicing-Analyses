## RNA Alternative Splicing Analyses

This page is the collection of how I learn and conduct analyses for bulk RNA sequence. 

The main analyses here, is to use the raw sequence for mapping, and then do the **Differential Gene Expression analysis**, **Alternative Splicing Analysis**, **Motif Enrichment Analysis** and **Chromosome Analysis**.

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LitingKu/RNA-Alterntaive-Splicing-Analyses/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
